## Let's be honest  
I'm in the school cafeteria right now, at study hall, trying to think of something to do. My laptop is at 17% (which is basically nothing given its current condition), and I decide, hey, let's write a blog post. I created (and still haven't finished) this blog sometime in July, and now, two months later I'm actually getting to writing something. For reference, I don't even know if this method of creating a post even works. We'll have to see. Let's get this done before my battery dies.  
## What method?  
This blog uses netlifycms, but actually I don't like netlifycms so we're not gonna use it. lol So instead what we're gonna do is use [github.dev](https://github.dev), which is basically just VSCode in a browser for making simple changes to your GitHub repos, reviewing pull requests, and stuff like that. The idea is that we can push this change we're currently writing and then Vercel or Netlify or whatever we decided to use will rebuild the blog site. Oh and also I tried uploading an image. If you see the header image or thumbnail, that means it worked. Giving it about a 35% chance of working.  
## Why do you sometimes reference yourself as "we"
Hmm. Maybe I'll write a blog post about that üëç
## Why did you make so many spelling mistakes
Did I actually? There's no spellcheck *yet*, maybe there's an extension for that? Also I probably didn't make that many mistakes.
## Why is your blog so bad
stop asking questions my laptop is at 11% and I still haven't pushed this
## Why is this formatted like an FAQ
Because you keep asking questions
## I'm you
the hell
